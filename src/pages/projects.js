      <h2>üåº Percent</h2>
      <p>
        <a href="https://percent.me">Percent</a> is a system to track
        overarching life goals and analyze if you&#39;re actually sticking to
        them.
      </p>
      <p>
        The idea came from a personal process I did myself for several months to
        quantify my life on a weekly basis ‚Äî although the first version was a
        spreadsheet with a bunch of formulas, there were enough features to
        justify building a standalone product.

      <h2>üêÄ Another Day in the Simulation</h2>
      <p>
        Inspired by Elon&#39;s <em>Occupy Mars</em> t-shirt, I created{" "}
        <a href="http://adits.world">ADITS</a> in 2018 after spending too much
        time thinking about the simulation theory. First collection is out
        (Classic) -- store is paused while I create a few more collections!

      <h2>üéè Zen</h2>
      <p>
        With <a href="http://zen.glitch.me">Zen</a>, I wanted to create a small
        set of &#39;rooms&#39; that would take me somewhere peaceful. I was
        feeling a lot of stress at the time and wished there was something
        pretty but boring to fall into for a quick mental break.
      </p>
      <p>
        It&#39;s built using <a href="http://threejs.org">three.js</a> and runs
        on <a href="http://glitch.com">Glitch</a>, a really cool platform to

      <h2>‚òÅÔ∏è Salesforce Starter</h2>
      <p>
        While at IBM I learned to develop in Salesforce and wrote some
        documentation for myself. I figured if anyone wants to save themselves a
        headache, they can avoid the endless Salesforce on-boarding docs and
        just read what I distilled{" "}
